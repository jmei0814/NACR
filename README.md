# NACR
This is the codebase for the autonomous NACR robot that I built and coded in November 2023.

The code is micropython for a Rasberry Pi Pico, and uses 2 sensors, the [Vl53l5CX time of flight sensor](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/vl53l5cx-ranging-camera/), as well as the [MP6050 gyroscopic sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3886).

Sensor code is adapted from these two pages:
https://github.com/mp-extras/vl53l5cx/tree/main

Here is a [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ckiwog776FQfPFKFRivqALKoJ3PmVueI/view?usp=sharing) to the attached wiring diagram and digital logic I coded.

It fought at Robot Day Fall 2023 at UIUC, and finished with a 1-2 record at 9th place.
Videos will be included soon.
